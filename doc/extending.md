# Extending baselayer

## Modifying the Tornado application

A Python function can be specified in the configuration as
`app.factory`, that will be used to create the Tornado
application. This is often needed to add additional routes, or do
certain setup procedures before the application is run.

The function should have the following argument signature:

```
def make_app(config, baselayer_handlers, baselayer_settings)
```

The configuration is passed in as the first parameter, followed by
baselayer-handlers (those should be appended to your Tornado handlers,
to put in place system endpoints such as logging in). The last
argument contains baselayer-specific Tornado configuration.

A typical `make_app` could be:

```
from baselayer.app.app_server import MainPageHandler

def make_app(config, baselayer_handlers, baselayer_settings):
       handlers = baselayer_handlers + [
           (r'/my_page', MyPageHandler),
           (r'/.*', MainPageHandler)
       ]

       settings = baselayer_settings
       settings.update({
           'tornado_config_key': 'tornado_config_value'
       })  # Specify any additional settings here

       app = tornado.web.Application(handlers, **settings)
       return app
```

## Templating

Often, values inside your JavaScript code or engineering configuration
files (nginx, supervisor, etc.) depend on settings inside
`config.yaml`. To simplify propagating these values, `baselayer`
provides templating functionality, applied to files named
`*.template`, before running the application. The template engine used
is [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com).

The configuration file is injected into the template, so you can
include their values as follows:

```
The database port is {{ database.port }}.
```

When you launch the `run` or `run_production` targets for baselayer,
it will automatically fill out all template files. Alternatively, you
can run the templating manually:

```
./baselayer/tools/fill_conf_values.py --config="config.yaml" static/js/component.jsx.template
```

## Adding external services

External services are [microservices](usage.md#microservices) that are cloned from a git repository and run as part of your application.
Their behavior is identical to built-in microservices, they just live in remote repositories.
This is useful for integrating third-party services or custom scripts.

Add external services in the `config.yaml` file under the `services.external` key:

```
services:
  external:
    my_service:
        repo: "https://github.com/my_service.git"
        rev: abc01234  # SHA revision specification
    another_service:
        url: "https://github.com/another_service.git"
        rev: v0.1.0  # tag revision specification
        params:
            endpoint: "https://api.example.com"
```

You must provide the `repo` git URL, as well as a revision (SHA, tag, or branch).

Additional configuration options can be passed through the `params` dictionary, which the service uses.

The external service will then be started and managed by `supervisord` alongside other services.

### External Service Requirements

To work correctly with the application, external services should follow these conventions:

#### Entry Point

- The service should include a `main.py` file as its entry point.
- If the entry point differs, a `supervisord.conf` must be provided in the repository, pointing to the correct entry point.

#### Project Metadata and Compatibility

External services may include a `pyproject.toml` file to provide metadata and compatibility information.
It specifies plugin meta-data, and also compatibility with other packagesâ€”enforced by baselayer.

In this file:

```toml
[project]
name = "my_service"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A micro-service to add to an application built on top of baselayer"
authors = [
  { name = "John Doe", email = "john.doe@example.com" }
]

[tool.compatibility]
compatible-with = [
  { name = "skyportal", version = ">=1.4.0" }
]
```

- The name of the service must be specified, matching the external service name in `config.yaml`.

- It may define a `[tool.compatibility]` section with a `compatible-with` field. This field specifies which package versions the service is compatible with. If the version requirement is not met, the external service will not be started.

#### Default Configuration

A `config.yaml.defaults` file can be provided to set service configuration defaults.
These values can be overridden in the app's `config.yaml` under the `services.external.<name-of-this-service>.config` keys:

```yaml
services:
  external:
    my_service:
      params:
        endpoint: "https://api.example.com"
```
